        <h1>Polymorphism in Python</h1>
        <p>Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes
            to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single function, method, or operator to
            operate on different types of objects, promoting flexibility and code reusability.</p>

        <h2>1. What is Polymorphism?</h2>
        <p>Polymorphism is derived from the Greek words "poly" (meaning "many") and "morph" (meaning "forms"). In
            Python, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own
            unique way, based on their class.</p>

        <h2>2. Types of Polymorphism in Python</h2>
        <p>Python supports two primary types of polymorphism:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Compile-time Polymorphism</strong> (also known as method overloading): Not natively supported in
                Python, but can be implemented in a limited way using default arguments.</li>
            <li><strong>Runtime Polymorphism</strong> (also known as method overriding): Supported through inheritance,
                where subclasses override methods in a superclass.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Method Overriding</h2>
        <p>Method overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism, where a subclass provides a specific implementation
            of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The overridden method in the subclass is called, even
            if the object is of the superclass type.</p>
        <pre><code>class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Some generic animal sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Bark!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Using polymorphism
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())  # Output: Bark!, Meow!</code></pre>

        <h2>4. Using <code>super()</code> in Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>The <code>super()</code> function allows subclasses to access and extend the behavior of superclass methods.
            This is especially useful in polymorphism when a subclass wants to add to or customize a method from its
            superclass rather than replacing it completely.</p>
        <pre><code>class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)  # Calls Animal's __init__
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        parent_speak = super().speak()  # Calls Animal's speak
        return f"{parent_speak} and barks"

# Using super() in subclass method
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy makes a sound and barks</code></pre>

        <h2>5. Operator Overloading</h2>
        <p>Python allows us to redefine the functionality of operators for user-defined classes through special methods
            (also called "magic methods"). This is known as operator overloading.</p>
        <pre><code>class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"

# Overloading + operator
v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(5, 7)
print(v1 + v2)  # Output: (7, 10)</code></pre>

        <h2>6. Polymorphism with Functions and Objects</h2>
        <p>Functions in Python can take any object that meets the interface requirements (known as "duck typing").
            Python uses dynamic typing, which means that as long as an object has the required methods or attributes, it
            can be passed to a function.</p>
        <pre><code>class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        return "Flying in the sky"

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        return "Flying through the clouds"

def start_flying(obj):
    print(obj.fly())

# Both classes have fly() method
bird = Bird()
plane = Airplane()
start_flying(bird)   # Output: Flying in the sky
start_flying(plane)  # Output: Flying through the clouds</code></pre>
        <h2>7. Polymorphism with Inheritance and Subclasses</h2>
        <p>Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit properties and methods from a superclass. Through polymorphism,
            subclasses can override or extend the functionality of inherited methods.</p>
        <pre><code>class Shape:
def area(self):
pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
def __init__(self, width, height):
self.width = width
self.height = height

def area(self):
return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
def __init__(self, radius):
self.radius = radius

def area(self):
return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)

# Calculating areas for different shapes
shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3)]
for shape in shapes:
print(f"Area: {shape.area()}")  # Output: Area of Rectangle, Area of Circle</code></pre>


        <h2>8. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) and Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>Abstract base classes (ABCs) enforce that subclasses implement certain methods, ensuring polymorphism. ABCs
            can be defined using the <code>abc</code> module.</p>
        <pre><code>from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Bark!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Abstract base class enforces polymorphic behavior
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())  # Output: Bark!, Meow!</code></pre>

        <h2>8. Real-world Example of Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>Consider an e-commerce application where different types of products require the same interface for
            calculating discounts. Each product type can implement its own discount calculation logic.</p>
        <pre><code>class Product:
def calculate_discount(self):
    pass

class Electronics(Product):
def calculate_discount(self):
    return "20% discount on electronics"

class Clothing(Product):
def calculate_discount(self):
    return "10% discount on clothing"

# Applying polymorphism
products = [Electronics(), Clothing()]
for product in products:
print(product.calculate_discount())  # Output: discount details for each product type</code></pre>

        <hr>

        <h2>Summary of Polymorphism in Python</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Method Overriding</strong>: Allows subclasses to provide specific implementations for inherited
                methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Operator Overloading</strong>: Redefines the behavior of operators for user-defined classes
                using magic methods (e.g., <code>__add__</code>, <code>__str__</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Using <code>super()</code></strong>: Allows subclasses to access and extend methods from their
                superclass.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymorphism with Functions and Objects</strong>: Functions can operate on any object that meets
                interface requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymorphism with Inheritance</strong>: Inherited classes can override methods, enabling
                flexible use of base and subclass methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Abstract Base Classes</strong>: Enforce polymorphic behavior by ensuring subclasses implement
                specific methods.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Understanding polymorphism, especially with <code>super()</code>, allows developers to write flexible,
            reusable, and modular code, making it easier to manage complex systems in Python.</p>
